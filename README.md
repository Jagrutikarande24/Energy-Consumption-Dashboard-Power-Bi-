Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA on the preprocessed data using Python. This step includes performing statistical analysis, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in the data.

Export Data to Power BI:
Exported the preprocessed data and the results of the EDA and modeling steps to Power BI using a suitable file format xlsx.

Create the Dashboard:
In Power BI, created a new report and added visualizations such as tables, charts, and graphs to represent the analyzed data. Used Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create a dashboard that effectively communicates the insights you have gained from the analysis.
